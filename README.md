### Overview
Inside this repository are snippets from the project I worked on during my time as a Frontend Developer with Environemtnal Material Sciences (EMS). The project involved designing and developing a protected, multi-page dashboard for the company’s clients. The purpose of the dashboard was to display complex data in a way that was both understandable and actionable.

### Description
To begin the process of designing the dashboard, I gathered information from relevant parties. I did this by conducting client interviews and collaborating with company leadership. Once I'd gathered this information, I developed my initial design using Figma. Based on further client interviews, and feedback from leadership I iterated upon my design extensively. Once myself and leadership were happy with the design, I began development.

Some complicating factor behind the dashboard's development were the data the dashboard would show, and the different groups that it had to be shown to. To begin with, the dashboard had to show real-time data. This meant that the dashboard relied extensively on API calls, and that testing and error handling needed to be robust. Additionally, the variety of clients and client sites had to be accounted for when automating the set up of the dashboard. After developing the initial dashboard, four distinct variations of the dashboard had to be developed, for the four different types of clients. 

By the end of the project, the dashboard was fully functional for over 40 different client sites with over a dozen clients.

### Tools and Technologies
The dashboard was developed for React.js using JavaScript. I used components from Material UI when possible, and developed my own components otherwise. I customized components extensively using CSS, for a tailored user experience. I also took advantage of various additional libraries, including:

- Recharts for some data visualization
- Axios for API calls
- Secure-ls to store and retrieve login information
- Cypress for testing
- I made use of Postman and MongoDB when integrating and confirming successful API calls
- And more

Unfortunately, the entirety of the project’s code is not available to the public at this time.
